# Simple Linear Regression: Salary Prediction

This Simple Linear Regression is a fictional case study based on a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression)
Tool: jupyter notebook

## Fictional Case:

Company X provided you with employee data containing information about its employees experience time and salaries. The company is about to hire a new employee and wants you to estimate the salary for the new employee considering the time of experience.

## Linear Regression 
Linear regression assumes a causal relationship between two continuous variables.

The linear regression model has the following formula: Y ~ A + BX + error

Where Y is the result variable, A the intercept, B the slope and X the explanatory variable. That is, in a linear regression, Y varies as a function of BX plus a constant value A. When X = 0, A = Y (intercept). The slope B represents the rate at which Y increases in relation to X. From a set of data it is possible to estimate the values of A and B, as well as the errors associated with these parameters. In doing so, we can plot the line that best fits our data, that is, the line that minimizes the sum of squares of the Error.
